"""Association direction: the profile snapshot against the generic serializer rule.

A profile writes an association on the class that owns the property (the snapshot key
``Class.Role``); no profile lists both ends. The generic CIMXML/JSON-LD writers pick the written
end with `association_write_end` (single-valued end first, else the name that sorts first). Of the
233 profile associations, the generic rule picks the other end for the nine below and for 45 of the
Dynamics profile. A profile (CGMES) writer must use the snapshot's owner, not `is_write_end`.
