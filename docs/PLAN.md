# CIM100 Python SDK: plan

Written 2026-10-27 from the planning agent's research. Scope: every CIM100 class can be instantiated in memory. Serialization is out of scope.

## Source model
- **Primary:** `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cimug-org/CIMTool/2a47a3778963da9389c9d50b91e92439470021e4/CSharpEFTestProject/CSharpEFTestProject/Schema/iec61970cim17v40_iec61968cim13v13b_iec62325cim03v17b_CIM100.1.1.1.qea`
  - 42,672,128 bytes (planner originally wrote 42,663,936; verified by sha256 in M1), sha256 `677355eaad0c7a1321788c0301e0e24c66c8567c5560dab8d7788974c98cf710`
  - The repo is LGPL-2.1, but the UML file states public domain / Apache-2.0.
- **Mirror** (Apache-2.0 repo; content identical, bytes differ): `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/netbeheernederland/tc57cim/91d32217c396bbaa379bc29a5e8bc3cda6f17f07/src/data/iec61970cim17v40_iec61968cim13v13b_iec62325cim03v17b_CIM100.1.1.1.qea`
  - sha256 `feb5c3c51b8efc2e66bc917b3f5be43bf1d0e6434cb235da5b486869a5944454`
- **Format:** EA 16 `.qea`, which is SQLite, read with stdlib `sqlite3`.
- **Versions:** IEC61970CIM17v40, IEC61968CIM13v13b, IEC62325CIM03v17b.
- **Caching:** the file goes in `build/model/` (gitignored) and is never committed.

## Expected model contents (scope `Model/TC57CIM`)
| Item | Count |
|---|---|
| Classifiers | 1,947 |
| Plain classes | 1,426 |
| «enumeration» | 405 (3,211 literals) |
| «CIMDatatype» | 56 |
| «Compound» | 50 |
| «Primitive» | 10 |
| Attribute rows | 9,545 (~6,330 non-literal) |
| Associations | 1,356 + 18 aggregations |
| Generalizations | 1,238 |

Packages: 174.

## Parser facts the code must handle
- **Inheritance:** single only.
- **Association ends:** cardinality is always filled in. 33 associations have no role name on one end. Navigability is mostly unspecified, so generate both ends.
- **EA role convention:** `SourceRole`/`SourceCard` describe the property on the *End* class that points back to the Start class. Example: Contingency.ContingencyElement is 0..\* and ContingencyElement.Contingency is 1.
- **Odd cardinalities:** `1..*`, `2..*`, `0..2`, `0..n`, `1..`.
- **Duplicate class names:** Profile and ResourceCertification each appear in two packages. TroubleReportingKind and IEC61968CIMVersion are duplicated within one package.
- **Duplicate member names:** 21 classes, mostly a subclass re-declaring `kind` with a narrower enum, or a repeated role name.
- **Python keywords used as attribute names:** `and`, `or`, `not`, `class`. These are escaped with a trailing `_`.
- **Filtering:** take only connectors where both ends are `Object_Type='Class'` inside TC57CIM. This drops object links from the instance diagrams.

## Design
- **Classes:** plain generated classes with `__slots__` and keyword-only `__init__`. No dataclasses and no pydantic.
- **Runtime:** a hand-written `cim100/_runtime/` provides the `CimObject` base and the helpers that update both ends of 1:1, 1:N and N:M associations.
- **Layout:** `src/cim100/model/<std>/<pkg...>/<snake_class>.py`, plus a generated `_registry.py` and a lazy (PEP 562) top-level `__init__`.
- **Imports:** inheritance uses real imports; association types are string annotations under TYPE_CHECKING.
- **Associations:**
  - Upper bound 1 is a property whose setter keeps both ends in sync.
  - Upper bound >1 is a private list with Zepben-style `x` (generator), `num_x`, `get_x_by_mrid`, `add_x`, `remove_x` and `clear_x`.
  - Lower bounds are reported by `validate()` and not enforced at construction.
- **Types:**
  - Primitives map to Python types: Float→float, Integer→int, Boolean→bool, String→str, Decimal→Decimal, DateTime→datetime, Date→date, Time→time. Duration and MonthDay stay str.
  - CIMDatatype attributes hold their value type, with unit and multiplier as metadata.
  - Compounds become slotted value classes.
  - Enumerations become `enum.Enum` with the CIM literal spellings.
- **Naming:** members are snake_case. Duplicate class names: the canonical one is exported at the top level, the other is reachable only by its module path. The generator fails on any collision it does not recognise.
- **Metadata:** every generated class has `_cim_meta` (package, EA GUID, multiplicities), which the completeness tests use.
- **What is committed:** generated code, checked with `tools/regen.py --check`, and the IR JSON snapshot.

## Decisions (decided by recommendation; Michael gave blanket autonomy on 2026-10-27)
1. Scope is TC57CIM, including the Inf\* and PackageDependencies packages. European extensions are left out.
2. mRID is optional and defaults to `str(uuid4())`.
3. The IR JSON snapshot is committed, so tests run offline.
4. The generated code is committed, with `--check` in the tests.
5. Classes marked «deprecated» and the Inf\* packages are generated and flagged in metadata.
6. Lower bounds are reported by `validate()` only.
7. Build models are chosen to save cost. Opus builds only M2 (EA reader) and M4 (association runtime). The others use sonnet. Reviews use sonnet.

## Milestones (one agent and one commit each, run in order)
| # | Work | Acceptance | Model |
|---|---|---|---|
| M0 | uv project `cim100-sdk` (py3.12), pyproject (jinja2; dev: pytest, ruff), .gitignore, README, `src/cim100/`, `codegen/`, `tools/`, `tests/` | `uv run pytest` passes; ruff is clean | sonnet |
| M1 | `model-source.toml` and `tools/fetch_model.py` (download, sha256, SQLite header, cache in `build/model/`, mirror fallback) | A wrong hash fails; a test checks the IEC61970CIMVersion version is IEC61970CIM17v40 (skipped if the model is absent) | sonnet |
| M2 | `codegen/ir.py` and `codegen/ea_reader.py` write `codegen/snapshot/cim100_ir.json` (sorted, deterministic) | Counts match the table above; output is identical on every run; role/cardinality mapping is tested | opus |
| M3 | `codegen/normalize.py` handles snake_case, keyword escaping, duplicate classes/members, overrides, generated role names and type resolution; writes `codegen/snapshot/naming_report.md` | No unresolved names; known collisions are unit-tested | sonnet |
| M4 | `src/cim100/_runtime/`: CimObject, two-way link helpers, enum/datatype bases; tested on a hand-written mini model | Both ends stay consistent through set/replace/remove/clear; no recursion | opus |
| M5 | `codegen/generate.py` and Jinja2 templates generate the package, `_registry.py`, lazy `__init__` and `py.typed`; `tools/regen.py [--check]` | Generation runs cleanly; ruff is clean; a second run gives no diff | sonnet |
| M6 | Commit the generated package and `tests/sdk/`: completeness against the IR, two-way checks on every association, every concrete class instantiates, importing everything takes <3 s | All tests pass offline; the regen check is clean | sonnet |

Later: CIMXML/RDF I/O; network container/services; API docs; `.eap`/CSV reader backend.

## Model facts (verified by M2 against the .qea, 2026-10-27)
Counts are pinned in `tests/test_ea_reader.py` and printed by `tools/dump_ir.py`.
- **Counts:** all planned counts match (1,947 classifiers: 1,426 class, 405 enumeration with 3,211 literals, 56 CIMDatatype, 50 Compound, 10 Primitive; 1,356 associations + 18 aggregations; 1,238 generalizations; 9,545 attribute rows = 3,211 literals + 6,334 attributes).
- **Packages: 173, not 174.** `t_package` has 174 rows, but one is the `Model` root. The TC57CIM subtree (TC57CIM itself and its descendants) is 173. Top-level standards: IEC61968, IEC61970, IEC62325, PackageDependencies.
- **Object types:** every classifier is `Object_Type='Class'`, including enumerations. Kind comes from `t_object.Stereotype` (None/enumeration/CIMDatatype/Compound/Primitive). `t_xref` (`Name='Stereotypes'`) carries the full stereotype list, sometimes with repeated rows. The only extra classifier stereotype is `deprecated` on SVCControlMode. 16 attributes carry a `deprecated` stereotype. `t_object.Abstract` is `0` for every class, so the model marks no class abstract.
- **No duplicate attribute rows.** No rows are exact duplicates by (Object_ID, Name, Type, Default), so 0 are removed. The "3 copies of `version`" are really 3 separate IEC61968CIMVersion classes (two in DocIEC61968, one directly in IEC61968). The columns are `COLLATE NOCASE`, so a SQL `GROUP BY` wrongly reports UnitSymbol `m`/`M`, `s`/`S`, `h`/`H`, UnitMultiplier `m`/`M` etc. as duplicates. Dedupe in Python, case-sensitively.
- **Type resolution:** 6,330 attributes resolve through `t_attribute.Classifier`, and 4 resolve by name (all of type `Mass`, Classifier=0). 0 are unresolved. Attribute types are only cimdatatype/primitive/enumeration/compound, never a plain class. `Classifier` on enum literals is noise (62 nonzero), so it is ignored.
- **Roles:** 33 associations have **no role name on either end** (not "one end"). For 30 of the 33, the start class is in an Inf* package. The other 3 start in Base/StateVariables, Base/Wires and MarketOperations/ReferenceData. M3 must generate role names for them. No association has exactly one role missing. One role has a leading space (`" MktContingencyA"`) and 4 attribute names have a trailing space. The reader strips all of these.
- **Aggregation:** the 18 Aggregations are `DestIsAggregate=1` (End class is the whole). 51 plain Associations also set Source/DestIsAggregate (1=shared, 2=composite). This is kept as `owner_aggregation` on the end owned by the whole. 255 associations mark the Dest end navigable; the rest are unspecified.
- **Cardinalities used:** `1`, `0..1`, `0..*`, `1..*`, `2..*`, `0..2`, `0..n`, `1..`. A bare `*` never occurs but is accepted. Attribute bounds are only 0..1 (6,286) or 1..1 (48).
- **Notes:** EA uses an HTML subset (`i b u sub sup font ul ol li img a`) plus entities (`&lt;&lt;Compound&gt;&gt;`). Notes also contain literal pseudo-tags such as `<was Switch data.>` and `<type>.<domain>`, so only known tags are stripped.
- **Versions:** IEC61970CIM17v40, IEC61968CIM13v13b, IEC62325CIM03v17b, PackageDependenciesCIMVersion=10.

# Phase 2: serialization and the MV-LV networks (2026-10-27)

## Decisions
Michael approved the recommendations and asked for JSON as an extra step.
- **Formats:** CIMXML (IEC 61970-552 RDF/XML) and CIM JSON-LD, following the UCAIug spec in cimug-org/CIM_JSON-LD_Syntax. Both are generic, driven by `_cim_meta`, and have a writer and a reader.
- **LV networks:** not modelled. Each distribution transformer secondary gets one LV ConnectivityNode with one EquivalentInjection, whose p/q are left empty (a static model). The transformer type (RES/COM) and its customer and PV counts go in name/description.
- **Phases:** SWER and two-phase lines and transformers are modelled with explicit phases (ACLineSegmentPhase, PhaseCode on Terminal and PowerTransformerEnd).
- **Network code:** goes in a new local repo `~/claude_code/cim100-networks`, which depends on the SDK through a uv path dependency. Source data comes from `~/claude_code/MV-LV-Networks` (BSD-3-Clause) and is not copied into our repos.
- **SDK branch:** `feat/serialization`, branched from `feat/cim100-sdk`.

## Milestones
| # | Work | Repo | Model |
|---|---|---|---|
| S1 | Generic CIMXML writer and reader `cim100.serialization.cimxml`, plus a shared format-neutral layer (object collection, property naming, value encoding), with round-trip tests | sdk | sonnet |
| S2 | CIM JSON-LD writer and reader `cim100.serialization.jsonld`, reusing that layer, with round-trip tests and CIMXML↔JSON-LD equivalence | sdk | sonnet |
| S3 | Excel→CIM builder for the 4 networks, with count tests against the sheets | networks | opus |
| S4 | Export the 4 networks to .xml and .jsonld, round-trip them, and write a summary report | networks | sonnet |

# Phase 3: CGMES 3.0 profiles (2026-10-31)

## Goal
Choose a CGMES 3.0 profile (EQ, SSH, TP, SV, ...) and use the existing `cim100` classes within it:
discover which classes and properties the profile has, validate a network against it, and write and
read CGMES file sets (one CIMXML file per profile, with `md:FullModel` headers) that other CGMES
tools accept. Objects stay ordinary `cim100` objects; profiles are a view, not a second class tree.

## Source
- `cimug-org/CGMES-CIM17` (Apache-2.0), commit `1c7708f5d3bde53e154201707f31961573868cf2`,
  `CGMES-CIM17/Profiles/*.owl` (CIMTool RDFS/OWL for IEC 61970-600-2:2021, i.e. CGMES 3.0).
- Pinned like the EA model: `profile-source.toml` (commit + per-file sha256), fetched into
  `build/profiles/` (gitignored). The derived profile snapshot is committed so tests run offline.

## Facts from the investigation (2026-10-31)
- CGMES 3.0 uses the namespace `http://iec.ch/TC57/CIM100#`, the same as this SDK.
- Every CIM100 class referenced by the 10 OWL files exists in the SDK. Every CIM100 property in
  EQ, TP, SSH, OP, GL and DL exists. Gaps: `VsConverter.uf` (SV), `Simple_Float.value` (SV, SSH).
  The ShortCircuit OWL carries about 15 stale CIM15/16 properties
  (e.g. `PhaseTapChanger.TransformerWinding`, namespace `.../2010/CIM-schema-cim15`): a defect in
  the source; report them as known source gaps, do not model them.
- European extensions, namespace `http://iec.ch/TC57/CIM100-European#` (`eu:`), are not in the SDK:
  classes `BoundaryPoint`, `WindPowerPlant`, `SolarPowerPlant`, enum `LimitKind`; properties
  `IdentifiedObject.shortName`, `IdentifiedObject.energyIdentCodeEic`, `OperationalLimitType.kind`,
  `WindGeneratingUnit.WindPowerPlant`, `SolarGeneratingUnit.SolarPowerPlant`, `BoundaryPoint.*`.
  EQ, EQBD and TP use them.
- The Dynamics OWL is empty (the source README says it is unfinished). Skip DY.
- OWL facts: the ontology header has only label/comment (no keyword, no conformsTo URI, no version);
  `xml:base` is `http://ucaiug.org/ns/CGMES/<Name>-EU/3.0`. Properties are `owl:Restriction`s on
  `rdfs:subClassOf` blank nodes (`owl:onProperty` + `owl:minCardinality`/`maxCardinality`/
  `allValuesFrom`); stereotypes via `uml:hasStereotype` (`concrete`, `byreference`, `european`,
  `attribute`, `enumeration`, ...). Profile classes are `#<Name>` subclassing `cim:<Name>`.
- Profile keywords and `dcterms:conformsTo`/`md:Model.profile` URIs (e.g.
  `http://iec.ch/TC57/ns/CIM/CoreEquipment-EU/3.0`) are not in the OWL; take them from
  IEC 61970-600-2 / ENTSO-E CGMES 3.0 sample files and record the source.

## Decisions (Michael approved the recommended design on 2026-10-31 and gave autonomy to finish)
1. Profile layer over the existing classes (not narrowed per-profile classes).
2. Profiles in scope: EQ, SSH, TP, SV first; then OP, SC, GL, DL, EQBD. DY skipped.
3. European extensions become real model members via codegen (an extension input merged into the
   IR), with a per-class/per-property namespace in the metadata, written with the `eu:` prefix.
4. Missing CIM17-2 members (`VsConverter.uf`, `Simple_Float.value`) and stale SC properties are
   recorded as known gaps, not modelled.
5. External check: ENTSO-E/powsybl CGMES 3.0 sample models must read; our output should import in
   pypowsybl (installed only in a scratch venv, never a project dependency).
6. Work is committed locally on `claude/cgmes-profile-support-1be5ef`, one commit per milestone.
   Nothing is pushed and no PR is opened without Michael.

## Milestones (one agent and one commit each, in order)
| # | Work | Model |
|---|---|---|
| C1 | `profile-source.toml`, `tools/fetch_profiles.py`, `codegen/owl_reader.py`, `tools/dump_profiles.py [--check]` writing the committed snapshot `src/cim100/profiles/data/cgmes_3_0.json` (per profile: keyword, name, base URI, conformsTo URI, classes with namespace/concrete flag, properties with namespace, kind, min/max, range/target, enum literals). Gap report vs the SDK pinned in tests. | opus |
| C2 | European extensions: extension input for codegen (from the snapshot's `eu:` members), namespace in `ClassMeta`/`AttrMeta`/`EndMeta`, regenerated model, CIMXML and JSON-LD writing/reading `eu:` names. Existing tests stay green; `regen.py --check` clean. | opus |
| R1 | Review C1+C2 (correctness, regen determinism, serializer namespace handling); orchestrator applies or delegates fixes. | sonnet |
| C3 | `cim100.profiles` runtime API: `Profile`/`ProfileSet`, `cgmes3.EQ` etc., `classes`, `properties(cls)`, `required(cls)`, `profiles_of(cls, prop)`; `cim100.profiles.cgmes3` facade re-exporting in-profile classes (with a generated `.pyi` for IDEs); `validate_profile(objects, profiles)` (class not in profile, property outside profiles, minCardinality, enum literal, concrete class). | sonnet |
| C4 | CGMES writer `write_cgmes(objects, out, profiles=..., header=...)`: one file per profile, `md:FullModel` header (created, scenarioTime, modelingAuthoritySet, profile URI, DependentOn, ...), only that profile's properties, `rdf:ID` in the defining profile and `rdf:about` elsewhere, `IdentifiedObject.mRID` written where the profile has it, associations written in the profile's direction, `eu:` namespace. Conventions verified against real CGMES 3.0 samples. | opus |
| C5 | CGMES reader `read_cgmes(paths or zip)`: merge a file set into one graph, cross-file references, headers kept, profile-aware warnings. Round trip of C4 output; ENTSO-E/powsybl CGMES 3.0 MicroGrid/MiniGrid samples read without unknown-property warnings beyond documented gaps. | sonnet |
| R2 | Review C3–C5 against the samples and the spec conventions; fixes. | sonnet |
| C6 | Example: export the four MV networks as CGMES 3.0 EQ/SSH/TP (SV only if values exist; TopologicalNodes derived from ConnectivityNodes), `validate_profile` clean, round trip, pypowsybl import if feasible; README sections for profiles and CGMES I/O. | sonnet |
| F | Orchestrator: full tests, ruff, regen checks, `docs/CGMES_REPORT.md` for Michael. | orchestrator |

## Orchestration
- The orchestrator (main session) runs each milestone as a background subagent with a self-contained
  brief, verifies the commit (tests, ruff, `regen.py --check`), records it in `docs/PROGRESS.md`,
  then starts the next. A failed or cut-off agent is retried once from its WIP state; a second
  failure is recorded as blocked and the next independent milestone continues.
- Usage limits: a session cron job resumes the orchestrator hourly from `docs/PROGRESS.md`.
