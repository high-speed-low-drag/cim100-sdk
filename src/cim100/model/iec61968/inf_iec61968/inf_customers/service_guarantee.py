    that guarantee's identifier is in the 'name' attribute and the status of the guarantee
    is in the 'Status.status' attribute.

    Example service requirements include:

    1) If power is not restored within 24 hours, customers can claim $50 for residential
    customers or $100 for commercial and industrial customers. In addition for each extra
    period of 12 hours the customer's supply has not been activated, the customer can claim
    $25.

    2) If a customer has a question about their electricity bill, the utility will
    investigate and respond to the inquiry within 15 working days. If utility fails to meet
    its guarantee, utility will automatically pay the customer $50."""
