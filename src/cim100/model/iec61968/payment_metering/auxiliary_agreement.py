    """An ad-hoc auxiliary account agreement associated with a customer agreement, not part of
    the customer's account, but typically subject to formal agreement between customer and
    supplier (utility). Typically this is used to collect revenue owed by the customer for
    other services or arrears accrued with the utility for other services. It is typically
    linked to a prepaid token purchase transaction, thus forcing the customer to make a
    payment towards settlement of the auxiliary account balance whenever the customer needs
    to purchase a prepaid token for electricity.

    The present status of the auxiliary agreement can be defined in the context of the
    utility's business rules, for example: enabled, disabled, pending, over recovered, under
    recovered, written off, etc."""
